# TTColliderController
(Not ready for TTMM yet - if this appears DO NOT DOWNLOAD!)

Control colliders on Techs to greatly reduce lag when building or showcasing huge Techs.  
Mostly intended for huge artbuilds.  Will not affect blocks that rely on collision to function.

Press ']' to enable the UI switches to toggle colliders.
Requires Nuterra.NativeOptions to rebind keys.
Supports Control Blocks.

Note: Disabling colliders yields greatly increased frames on large to huge builds (250+ Blocks) but will leave you unable to remove blocks or protect your cab properly. 

MT- related parts like the platforms, bearings, ETC along with the MotionBlocks grip pads are left untouched to let them do their job.
