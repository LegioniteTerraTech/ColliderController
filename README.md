# TTColliderController
Control colliders on Techs to greatly reduce lag when building or showcasing huge Techs.

Press ']' to enable the UI switches to toggle colliders.
Requires Nuterra.NativeOptions to rebind keys.

Note: Disabling colliders yields greatly increased frames on large to huge builds (250+ Blocks) but will leave you unable to remove block or protect your cab properly
